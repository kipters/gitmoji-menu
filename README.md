# Gitmoji

An emoji guide for your commit messages.

This app is inspired by the similar one made by [Meadow Cottage](https://github.com/Meadowcottage/gitmoji), but I felt like an Electron app was unnecessarily heavyweight, so I made my own, 100% native.

This one is smaller (437 KB vs 111 MB), faster and lightweight.
You can also let it run at startup.

Windows version coming soon!

## Development

### macOS
```
$ git clone https://github.com/kipters/gitmoji-menu.git
$ cd gitmoji-menu
$ open macOS/GitmojiWS.xcworkspace
```

### Windows
_coming soon!_

### Tools

The list is generated at runtime, starting from a JSON file.
This JSON file is generated by a .NET Core tool (`Tools\JsonBuilder`);

This tools downloads the `gitmoji.json` and `_vars.scss` files from Carlos' repository (if not already present) and outputs a `def.json` file containing the original JSON properties (minus the entity) + the color, extracted from the SASS file.

An up-to-date `def.json` is included in the repository, so you don't have to install .NET Core to build it.

This tool also supports two arguments:

`--fresh` deletes the cached files and downloads them again

`--format` the output json will be indented

## Support

Credit for creating Gitmoji goes to [Carlos Cuesta](https://carloscuesta.me/). Thank you Carlos!

Also kudos to Meadow Cottage for making his app, without his I wouldn't have made this one!

If you want to propose new gitmojis, submit an issue on the official [gitmoji repository](https://github.com/carloscuesta/gitmoji/).

If you want to submit a bug for this app feel free to open an issue, or even submit a pull request if you fixed one of the bugs!
